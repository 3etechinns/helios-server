<p>
    Welcome to the {{settings.SITE_TITLE}} Server.
</p>

<p>
    This site uses the <a href="http://heliosvoting.org">Helios Voting System</a> to enable individual voters
    to verify that their vote was correctly captured and tallied. Helios is a type of open-audit voting system,
    also called an end-to-end voting system.
</p>

<p>
    Because Helios is built to be used on the Web, it is appropriate <em><b>only for low-coercion elections</b></em>.
    Specifically, Helios is not appropriate at this time for governmental elections where the stakes are particularly high,
    and the risk of one voter attempting to influence another is very real.
